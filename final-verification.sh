echo "📱 MOBILE SUCCESS POPUP TEST INSTRUCTIONS"
echo "========================================="
echo ""
echo "The mobile app has been updated with improved timing for success popups."
echo "Here's how to test it:"
echo ""
echo "1. 🚀 Start the mobile app:"
echo "   npm run dev:mobile"
echo ""
echo "2. 📱 Navigate to check-in:"
echo "   - Open app in simulator/device"
echo "   - Go to 'Check In' tab"
echo "   - Choose either 'Inbound' or 'Outbound'"
echo ""
echo "3. 📝 Fill out the required fields:"
echo "   - Driver Name (required)"
echo "   - Phone Number (required)"  
echo "   - Vehicle ID (required)"
echo "   - Pickup/Delivery Location (required)"
echo "   - Pickup/Delivery Address (required)"
echo ""
echo "4. 🗺️ Geofence simulation:"
echo "   - App randomly simulates being outside geofence (70% chance)"
echo "   - If outside: 'Override Check-In' button appears"
echo "   - If inside: 'Submit Check-In' button appears"
echo ""
echo "5. 🔄 Test Override Check-In (most common scenario):"
echo "   - Click 'Override Check-In'"
echo "   - Modal appears asking for reason"
echo "   - Enter reason (e.g., 'Traffic delay')"
echo "   - Click 'Submit Override'"
echo ""
echo "6. 👀 Watch for success popup:"
echo "   - Modal will close first"
echo "   - Console logs will show timing:"
echo "     '🚀 Submitting [inbound/outbound] override check-in...'"
echo "     '✅ [Inbound/Outbound] override check-in response:'"
echo "     '🔒 Modal closed, waiting before showing success...'"
echo "     '🎉 Now showing success popup for [inbound/outbound] override check-in'"
echo "   - Success popup appears after 800ms delay"
echo "   - Success popup shows all check-in details + override reason"
echo ""
echo "7. ✅ What should happen:"
echo "   - Override modal closes smoothly"
echo "   - Brief pause (800ms)"
echo "   - Success popup appears with all details"
echo "   - Notification appears in web dashboard"
echo "   - When channel is created from notification, notification is deleted permanently"
echo ""
echo "🔧 If success popup still doesn't appear:"
echo "   - Check console logs for timing messages"
echo "   - Ensure all required fields are filled"
echo "   - Try increasing delay in submitOverrideCheckIn function"
echo ""
echo "🌐 Test Web Dashboard:"
echo "   - Open http://localhost:3010 in browser"
echo "   - Check-in should appear as notification with override indicator"
echo "   - Create channel from notification"
echo "   - Notification should be deleted and not reappear"

echo ""
echo "🎯 BOTH ISSUES SHOULD NOW BE FIXED:"
echo "✅ Notifications persist deletion (don't come back)"
echo "✅ Success popup appears reliably after override modal closes"
